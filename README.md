## Introduction

The child behavior detection system leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze input data and classify behaviors. This project encompasses data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- Collects and preprocesses data from various sources.
- Extracts features relevant to child behavior.
- Trains ML models using labeled datasets.
- Evaluates model performance and accuracy.
- Provides a predictive system for classifying child behavior.

## Data Collection

The system collects data from multiple sources such as text documents, activity logs, and user behavior. Ensure data privacy and compliance with data protection regulations during collection.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing includes cleaning, normalizing, and structuring the data. Techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization are applied for text data.

## Model Training

Machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks are employed. The system is trained using labeled datasets where child behaviors have been previously identified.

## Evaluation

The trained model is validated and tested using various metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability. Continuous refinement and retraining are performed to maintain system performance.
